# RC4, Intensive Research Training Program (IRTP) Seminar Series - 2024 Winter
**Please refer to the following link to check the [next seminar (2024 - Summer)](https://github.com/powersimmani/RC4_IRTP_Seminar_2024_Summer)**

Organized by Ho-min Park (Ph.D. Student, Ghent University)

During the winter of 2023-2024, the Center for Biosystems and Biotech Data Science (RC4) at Ghent University Global Campus successfully conducted four winter training programs. These initiatives were specifically designed for undergraduate students, with the primary goal of deepening their understanding of their respective fields and equipping them with the necessary skills to apply this knowledge in practical research settings. The programs, which commenced in January 2024 and concluded in February, covered a broad range of topics, encouraging participants to engage in comprehensive self-study and tackle problem-solving exercises relevant to their subjects of interest.

Recognizing the importance of documenting and sharing research outcomes, RC4 facilitated a platform for participants to present their findings. This took the form of a 15-minute PowerPoint presentation, followed by a 5-minute question-and-answer session, allowing students to discuss their work and the insights they gained throughout the program. These presentations were held across two days, February 26th and 27th, between 6:20 PM and 8:20 PM, providing an invaluable opportunity for knowledge exchange and feedback.

Below, you can find detailed information regarding the programs' supervisors, advisors, titles, and access to the PowerPoint presentations and related materials submitted by the students, showcasing the diverse range of projects undertaken during these winter training programs.
