# RC4, Intensive Research Training Program (IRTP) Seminar Series

Organized by Ho-min Park (Ph.D. Student, Ghent University)

Over the winter of 2023 - 2024, RC4, Center for Biosystems and Biotech Data Science, conducted four winter training programs. These programs were aimed at undergraduate students of Ghent University Global Campus, intending to deepen their subject knowledge and enable them to apply this knowledge to practical research. Most of the programs started in January 2024 and concluded in February. Participating students engaged in self-study of theories and practices and worked on solving problems relevant to their given topics. Believing that it's important to organize and record outcomes regardless of their size, I created a session where students who participated in the program could present what they had studied and the results they had achieved during this period in a 15-minute PPT presentation followed by a 5-minute Q&A session. These presentations took place over two days, on February 26th and 27th, from 6:20 PM to 8:20 PM. Information about the supervisors, advisors, program titles, and the PPTs and related materials presented by the students can be found below.
